# Dead Simple Majority Sleeps Plugin

**Theoretically compatible with all Spigot/Bukkit servers 1.8.X/1.9.X**

This is a simple, sloppy plugin I wrote in one afternoon because I
couldn't find a decent alternative. All you have to do is throw the
.jar into your `plugins/` folder, then do any further configuration
via the `config.yml` file, which should be generated the first time you 
start your server with the plugin installed. By default, the server will 
skip to dawn once 50% or more of the players are sleeping, then display
a "Good morning!" message to everyone in the Overworld.

I've never written a plugin for ~~anything~~ Spigot before, but I think 
it turned out alright. Use at your own risk, but it *shouldn't* break 
anything. At least, it works on *my* machine.

Oh yeah, did I mention I haven't tested it with more than one player on
at a time? Let me know how it goes, please!
