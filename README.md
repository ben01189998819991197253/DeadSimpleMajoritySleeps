# Dead Simple Majority Sleeps Plugin

**Version:** Spigot/Minecraft 1.9.X (I think)

This is a simple, sloppy plugin I wrote in an afternoon because I
couldn't find a decent alternative. All you have to do is throw the
.jar into your `plugins/` folder, then do any further configuration
via the `config.yml` file, which should be generated the first time you 
run your server with the plugin installed. By default, the server will 
skip to dawn once 50% or more of the players are sleeping, then display
a "Good morning!" message to everyone in the Overworld.

I've never written a plugin for ~~anything~~ Spigot before, but I think 
it turned out alright. I have no idea what it's compatible with, so use
at your own risk, but it shouldn't break anything. At least, it works on
*my* machine.
